During my internship at **Amazon Web Services Vietnam Co., Ltd.** from **September 8, 2025** to **December 9, 2025**, I had the opportunity to immerse myself in a highly professional working environment that emphasized discipline, accountability, and continuous self-improvement. This experience allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of workplace standards, strengthen my professional mindset, and develop a more structured and methodical approach to completing assigned responsibilities.

During the internship, I participated in the **Everyonecook** project, contributing to tasks that aligned with the team’s development and operational activities. This involvement provided me with practical exposure to collaborative workflows and the application of cloud-based development practices in a real project environment.

Throughout the internship period, I consistently maintained a responsible attitude, adhered to organizational workflows, and cooperated effectively with colleagues to support shared objectives. I prioritized delivering assigned work with quality and within the expected timelines.
