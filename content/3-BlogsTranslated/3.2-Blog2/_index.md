Customers frequently tell me that they want a simpler path to meet their industry compliance and regulatory requirements across specific geographic regions. Through deep engagements with partners and customers, we have learned that one of the biggest challenges is translating security and compliance requirements into actionable technical controls.

At Amazon Web Services (AWS), security is our top priority, and we recognize that protecting your data in a world of evolving regulations, technology, and risks requires collaboration. As we have stated before, security is the foundation of digital sovereignty.

AWS helps organizations develop and evolve their capabilities across security, identity, and compliance into business enablers; this is why we are committed to working with national cybersecurity agencies and regulators to help define and translate their compliance standards into cloud security best practices. We are responding to customer requests for locally tailored approaches that align with regional standards set by domestic authorities.

## Architectural Best Practices – Locally Tailored  
*(Architectural best practice, locally tailored)*

Since its launch in 2022, the **Landing Zone Accelerator on AWS (LZA)** has helped thousands of customers deploy cloud foundations aligned with multiple global frameworks and AWS best practices, including:

- **Baseline Informatiebeveiliging Overheid (BIO)** – Netherlands  
- **Esquema Nacional de Seguridad (ENS)** – Spain  

AWS is committed to expanding region-specific deployments to help customers meet national, regional, and digital sovereignty requirements.

In March, we announced a collaboration agreement between the **Federal Office for Information Security (BSI)** and AWS — through which AWS is committed to advancing digital sovereignty and cybersecurity best practices in Germany and across the European Union (EU).

Therefore, we are excited to announce that the next region-specific deployment of the Landing Zone Accelerator on AWS will support workloads in **Germany**, with the **C5-ready Landing Zone Accelerator**, designed to help customers meet the compliance objectives of the **C5 (Cloud Computing Compliance Criteria Catalogue)** in the cloud.

Scheduled for release in **Q3 2025**, this deployment will also be available in the **AWS European Sovereign Cloud**.

## C5 Compliance and Partnership with Schellman  
*(C5 Compliance and Partnership with Schellman)*

The **C5 attestation scheme**, backed by the German government and introduced by BSI in 2016, helps organizations demonstrate operational security capabilities against common cyber threats when using cloud services.  
AWS has adhered to C5 requirements since the standard was introduced.

To help customers prepare for compliance assessments, AWS has partnered with **AWS Global Security & Compliance (GSCA) Partner – Schellman** to provide auditors with deep insights into how the **C5-ready Landing Zone Accelerator** can simplify and accelerate the journey to achieving C5 certification on AWS.

## Schellman – A Leading Partner in C5 Assessments  
*(Schellman: A Leading Partner in C5 Assessments)*

As one of the few companies with deep expertise in C5 assessments, Schellman has conducted dozens of audits across a wide range of customers — from agile startups to global enterprises.

> “Our team has seen firsthand how the C5 standard drives transparency and builds trust in cloud services. We are proud to not only help customers understand C5, but also understand how to leverage it to strengthen security and enhance global competitiveness.”  
> — **Jeff Schiess, Managing Director, Schellman**

Lowering barriers to entry — Schellman recognizes that achieving C5 compliance can sometimes feel overwhelming, particularly for organizations new to the framework.

To support customers, Schellman has conducted assessments on the **LZA on AWS** infrastructure, which is designed to simplify the path to C5 readiness.

> “With the Landing Zone Accelerator, organizations can start with a C5-ready foundation from day one. It is a practical and scalable solution for enterprises that traditionally viewed C5 as complex.”  
> — **Kristen Wilbur, Principal, Schellman**

## Sovereign by Design – Embedding Digital Sovereignty from the Start  
*(Sovereign by Design: Embedding Digital Sovereignty from the Start)*

The Landing Zone Accelerator on AWS automatically deploys hundreds of security capabilities mapped to control requirements from multiple regional compliance frameworks. This saves customers hundreds of hours of planning and security configuration, thanks to a foundation built on the **AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar** and **AWS security best practices**.

Core capabilities that customers need in sovereign-by-design workloads include:

- Meeting compliance requirements  
- Enforcing verifiable access control and data transfer restrictions  
- Ensuring autonomy in technology choices  
- Maintaining resilience to large-scale disruption  

AWS provides detailed guidance for configuring LZA to meet local security, compliance, and digital sovereignty needs, including **control mapping** to domestic regulations and internal security policies.

## Data Location and Access Control  
*(Data Location and Access Control)*

The Landing Zone Accelerator on AWS provides customers with configurable **preventive**, **detective**, and **proactive** controls that help them meet **data residency**, **security**, and **compliance** goals — whether they are:

- government agencies requiring data to remain in a **single AWS Region**, or  
- multinational enterprises with complex digital sovereignty requirements.

Beyond a secure multi-account environment, LZA establishes a **well-structured multi-account architecture** built on AWS Organizations, enabling:

- Workload isolation and delegated management  
- Strengthened security and operational efficiency  
- Consistent enforcement of data residency, access management, and compliance policies  

This allows customers to innovate quickly on the cloud while maintaining a strong security and compliance foundation.

## Partners at the Core of the Digital Sovereignty Ecosystem  
*(Partners at the Core of the Digital Sovereignty Ecosystem)*

AWS recognizes that navigating the digital sovereignty landscape requires collaboration.  
Through the **AWS Digital Sovereignty Competency**, customers can engage trusted partners with proven experience in designing and implementing sovereignty-aligned architectures while leveraging the full innovation capability of the AWS Cloud.

This program helps partners address challenges across four core pillars:

- Data Residency  
- Data Protection  
- Access Control  
- Survivability  

> “Compliance with standards such as C5 is essential for public sector and regulated industry customers, especially as they prioritize digital sovereignty. The launch of C5 LZA significantly reduces technical complexity, accelerates time to market, and drives innovation.”  
> — **Boris Hecker, Managing Director, ATOS Germany**

> “Customers in the public sector and highly regulated industries need solutions that both meet regulatory requirements and foster innovation. SVA trusts the Landing Zone Accelerator on AWS as a solution that balances compliance and innovation, combining leading public cloud infrastructure with local legal requirements.”  
> — **Patrick Glawe, Hyperscaler Lead, SVA**
