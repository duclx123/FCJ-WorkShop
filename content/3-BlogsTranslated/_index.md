###  [Blog 2 - Introducing New Region-Specific Landing Zone Accelerator Deployments on AWS to Support Digital Sovereignty](3.2-Blog2/)
AWS introduces new region-specific Landing Zone Accelerator (LZA) deployments to help customers meet local digital sovereignty and compliance requirements. The next launch, arriving in Q3 2025, delivers a C5-ready LZA for Germany and the AWS European Sovereign Cloud. AWS partners with Schellman to simplify C5 assessments and accelerate certification readiness. LZA provides sovereign-by-design foundations with automated security controls, data residency protections, and multi-account governance. The update strengthens AWS's commitment to security, compliance, and collaboration with European regulators.

###  [Blog 3 - Expanding AWS Fault Injection Service in Your Organization with Account Controls ](3.3-Blog3/)
AWS Fault Injection Service (FIS) enables organizations to run controlled chaos engineering experiments to validate system resilience. Network-related experiments often require elevated permissions, which can be challenging in centralized networking environments. The blog explains how to use AWS Organizations, SCPs, and IAM roles to safely enable FIS actions across accounts and Regions. Two standardized roles — Orchestrator and Executor — help enforce least privilege while allowing experiments to run. A sample SCP shows how to restrict sensitive network actions exclusively to the FIS Executor role.
