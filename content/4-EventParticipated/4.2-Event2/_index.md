# Event Report: AWS Cloud Mastery Series #2 — DevOps on AWS

## Purpose of the Event

- Reinforce the core DevOps mindset and cultural foundations.
- Introduce AWS services supporting CI/CD: CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline.
- Explore Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in depth using CloudFormation and AWS CDK.
- Dive into container services (ECS, EKS, App Runner) and observability tools (CloudWatch, X-Ray).

## Highlights

### Morning Session: CI/CD Pipeline & IaC (08:30 – 12:00)

- DevOps principles: clarified foundational concepts and DORA metrics (Deployment Frequency, MTTR, etc.).
- CI/CD services:
  - Source control: AWS CodeCommit and Git strategies (GitFlow vs. Trunk-based).
  - Build & test: AWS CodeBuild.
  - Deployment: AWS CodeDeploy with Blue/Green, Canary, and Rolling strategies.
  - Orchestration: automated integration through AWS CodePipeline.
- Live Demo: end-to-end demonstration of a full CI/CD pipeline.
- IaC:
  - CloudFormation: templates, stacks, drift detection.
  - AWS CDK: constructs, reusable patterns, and multi-language support.
- Demo & discussion: deploying with both CloudFormation and CDK; comparing when and why to choose each tool.

### Afternoon Session: Containers, Observability & Best Practices (13:00 – 17:00)

- Container services:
  - Docker fundamentals.
  - Amazon ECR: image storage, scanning, lifecycle rules.
  - ECS & EKS: deployment patterns, orchestration, and scaling.
  - App Runner: PaaS-style deployment for containerized workloads.
- Observability:
  - AWS CloudWatch: metrics, logs, alarms, dashboards.
  - AWS X-Ray: distributed tracing for microservices.
- Best practices:
  - Feature flags and A/B testing.
  - Incident management and postmortems.
- Demo & case study: comparing deployment strategies for microservices-based architectures.

## Key Takeaways

- DevOps culture: solid understanding of DORA metrics and an automation-first mindset.
- CI/CD: clear integration across the AWS Code suite; awareness of advanced deployment models like Blue/Green and Canary.
- IaC: foundational knowledge of CloudFormation and AWS CDK for optimizing templates and multi-stack infrastructure.
- Observability: reinforced the importance of CloudWatch and X-Ray for full-stack debugging (CORS, Lambda issues, etc.).
- Container services (ECS/EKS) serve as guidance for future complex architectures.
- Practical demos provided clarity on improving and refining deployment workflows.

## Event Experience

- The full-day workshop was highly detailed and practical, offering applicable hands-on knowledge.
- Live demos and case studies added strong value for real project implementation.
- The event provided meaningful networking opportunities with experts and the AWS community.
